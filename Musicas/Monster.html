                The secret side of me<br>
                I never let you see<br>
                I keep it caged, but I can't control it<br>
                So stay away from me<br>
                The beast is ugly<br>
                I feel the rage and I just can't hold it<br>
                <p></p>
                It's scratchin on the walls<br>
                In the closet, in the halls<br>
                It comes awake and I can't control it<br>
                Hidin under the bed<br>
                In my body, in my head<br>
                Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end<br>
                <p></p>
                I feel it deep within<br>
                It's just beneath the skin<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I hate what I've become<br>
                The nightmare's just begun<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                My secret side I keep<br>
                Hid under lock and key<br>
                I keep it caged, but I can't control it<br>
                'Cause if I let him out<br>
                He'll tear me up, break me down<br>
                Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end<br>
                <p></p>
                I feel it deep within<br>
                It's just beneath the skin<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I hate what I've become<br>
                The nightmare's just begun<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I feel it deep within<br>
                It's just beneath the skin<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                It's hidin in the dark<br>
                It's teeth are razor sharp<br>
                There's no escape for me<br>
                It wants my soul, it wants my heart<br>
                <p></p>
                No one can hear me scream<br>
                Maybe it's just a dream<br>
                Or maybe it's inside of me<br>
                Stop this monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I feel it deep within<br>
                It's just beneath the skin<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I hate what I've become<br>
                The nightmare's just begun<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I feel it deep within<br>
                It's just beneath the skin<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I gotta lose control<br>
                Is something radical<br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
                <p></p>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
                I, I feel like a monster<br>
