                    They tell me keep it simple<br>
                    I tell them take it slow<br>
                    I feed and water an idea<br>
                    So I let it grow<br>
                    I tell them take it easy<br>
                    They laugh and tell me no<br>
                    It’s cool but I don’t see them laughing<br>
                    At my money though<br>
                    <p></p>
                    They spittin facts at me<br>
                    I'm spittin tracks, catch me?<br>
                    I'm spinning gold out my records<br>
                    Know you can’t combat me<br>
                    They tell me Jesus walks<br>
                    I tell them money talks<br>
                    Bling got me chill<br>
                    'Cause I'm living in an ice box<br>
                    <p></p>
                    They tell me I've been sleepin'<br>
                    I say I'm wide awake<br>
                    Tracks hot and ready<br>
                    So they call me Mister E-Z Bake<br>
                    They say the grass is greener<br>
                    I think my grass is dank<br>
                    Drivin' with a drank<br>
                    On an empty tank to the bank<br>
                    <p></p>
                    Do you feel me?<br>
                    Take a look inside my brain<br>
                    The people always different<br>
                    But it always feels the same<br>
                    That’s the real me<br>
                    Pop the champagne<br>
                    The haters wanna hurt me<br>
                    And I'm laughin at the pain<br>
                    <p></p>
                    Stayin' still, eyes closed<br>
                    Let the world just pass me by<br>
                    Pain pills, nice clothes<br>
                    If I fall I think I’ll fly<br>
                    Touch me, Midas<br>
                    Make me part of your design<br>
                    None to guide us<br>
                    I feel fear for the very last time<br>
                    <p></p>
                    They tell me that I'm special<br>
                    I smile and shake my head<br>
                    I’ll give them stories to tell friends<br>
                    About the things I said<br>
                    They tell me I'm so humble<br>
                    I say I'm turning red<br>
                    They let me lie to them<br>
                    And don’t feel like they’ve been misled<br>
                    <p></p>
                    They give so much to me<br>
                    I'm losing touch, get me?<br>
                    Served on a silver platter<br>
                    Ask for seconds they just let me<br>
                    They tell me I'm a God<br>
                    I'm lost in the facade<br>
                    Six feet off the ground at all times<br>
                    I think I'm feelin' odd<br>
                    <p></p>
                    No matter what I make<br>
                    They never see mistakes<br>
                    Makin' so much bread<br>
                    I don’t care that they’re just being fake<br>
                    They tell me they’re below me<br>
                    I act like I'm above<br>
                    The people blend together<br>
                    But I would be lost without their love<br>
                    <p></p>
                    Can you heal me?<br>
                    Have I gained too much?<br>
                    When you become untouchable you’re unable to touch<br>
                    Is there a real me?<br>
                    Pop the champagne<br>
                    It hurts me just to think<br>
                    And I don’t do pain<br>
                    <p></p>
                    Stayin' still, eyes closed<br>
                    Let the world just pass me by<br>
                    Pain pills, nice clothes<br>
                    If I fall I think I’ll fly<br>
                    Touch me, Midas<br>
                    Make me part of your design<br>
                    None to guide us<br>
                    I feel fear for the very last time<br>
                    <p></p>
                    Lay still, restless<br>
                    Losing sleep while I lose my mind<br>
                    All thrill, no stress<br>
                    All my muses left behind<br>
                    World is, below<br>
                    So high up, I'm near divine<br>
                    Lean in, let go<br>
                    I feel fear for the very last time<br>
