            <H3>
            Your heart is pounding and it can't be stopped<br>
            You tell yourself you're okay<br>
            It's too bad your doors can't be locked<br>
            To keep the monsters away<br>
            <P></P>
            You check behind the door<br>
            There's nothing there no more<br>
            You should've stayed in bed<br>
            You've heard this noise before<br>
            You dart across the floor<br>
            Try not to lose your head<br>
            <P></P>
            Prepare for the horrors<br>
            This night will keep repeating over and over<br>
            And over, until you make it to the end<br>
            They hide 'round the corners<br>
            You better peel your eyes and keep looking over<br>
            Your shoulder 'cause you'll never be alone again<br>
            <P></P>
            First there was one, but now there might be three<br>
            You turn around just in time<br>
            You hear a chuckle and you turn back and see<br>
            The closet door's open wide<br>
            <P></P>
            You look around the space<br>
            And see a creepy face<br>
            Turns out it's just your toy<br>
            But it seems out of place<br>
            You leave it, just in case<br>
            It might be a decoy<br>
            <P></P>
            Prepare for the horrors<br>
