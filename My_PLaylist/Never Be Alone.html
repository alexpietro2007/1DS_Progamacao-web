                    Your heart is pounding and it can't be stopped
                    You tell yourself you're okay
                    It's too bad your doors can't be locked
                    To keep the monsters away
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    You check behind the door
                    There's nothing there no more
                    You should've stayed in bed
                    You've heard this noise before
                    You dart across the floor
                    Try not to lose your head
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    
                    Prepare for the horrors
                    This night will keep repeating over and over
                    And over
                    Until you make it to the end
                    They hide 'round the corners
                    You better peel your eyes and keep looking over
                    Your shoulder 'cause you'll never be alone again
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    First there was one, but now there might be three
                    You turn around just in time
                    You hear a chuckle and you turn back and see
                    The closet door's open wide
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    You look around the space
                    And see a creepy face
                    Turns out it's just your toy
                    But it seems out of place
                    You leave it, just in case
                    It might be a decoy
                    </p>
                    <br>
